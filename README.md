# About Me
I’m Kristóf, a Computer Engineering student at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I also work as a Full-Stack Developer Intern at evosoft Hungary. I am keen on Data Science, Computational Finance and Statistics. I am good with Web Technologies and working in the Cloud. I like working with Python, TypeScript, C/C++ and Java.

# Current Projects
## Lambdas
I am currently building [Lambdas](https://github.com/lambdastrade), a No-Code Algo Trading web application that allows you to create and deploy strategies using a flowchart-like visual interface.
## runtime_error
Me and 4 others are building a [school project](https://github.com/RuntimeError-BME) for the course Software Project Laboratory in Java, according to RUP and Object Oriented design.
Side note: please don't cringe at the README content, ChatGPT made it.
